    <div id="placeholder" style="width:600px;height:300px;"></div>

    <p>Simple example. You don't need to specify much to get an
       attractive look. Put in a placeholder, make sure you set its
       dimensions (otherwise the plot library will barf) and call the
       plot function with the data. The axes are automatically
       scaled.</p>
